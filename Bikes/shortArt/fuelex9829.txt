Fuel EX 9.8 is the versatile carbon trail bike that can climb with the XC crowd and throw down with the rowdy trail crew. A lightweight OCLV Mountain Carbon frame, 1x12 SRAM GX Eagle drivetrain, carbon wheels, and FOX Performance Float suspension with Trek's exclusive RE:aktiv with Thru Shaft shock make it the perfect choice for all-mountain shredders who want a single bike that does it all.
