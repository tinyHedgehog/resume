Full Stache 8 is a full suspension 29+ trail bike with an oversized appetite for rugged backcountry riding. Sure-footed mid-fat tires, a 1x12 drivetrain, 130mm of front and rear travel, super short chainstays, and some ridiculously clever engineering make this 29+ trail bike the ideal rig for rugged singletrack and trail explorations into the unknown wild.
