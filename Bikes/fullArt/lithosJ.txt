<h4>Techy trails need a technical tee</h4>
Finally, a tee ready to ride as hard as you do. The Lithos tech tee is a performance mountain bike top for bombing big trails or claiming enduro wins. The loose fit provides casual style with enough space to throw on pads when necessary. Additional cycling-specific features like a drop tail and sunglass wipe make this top much more than a glorified t-shirt.
