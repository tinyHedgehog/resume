<h4>It's right for you if...</h4>
At night, when you're lying in bed after a hard ride, you close your eyes and dream of carbon and the best XC parts available. Whether you're racing or training, you want to be the fastest. You want a bike that exceeds expectations in all categories-light weight, strength, speed, and efficiency. 
<h4>The tech you get</h4>
Here's the truth: there's not much on this bike that isn't carbon. Our superlight OCLV Mountain Carbon frame, Bontrager Kovee Pro 30 carbon wheels with a 108-tooth Rapid Drive hub, SRAM XX1 Eagle 1x12 drivetrain, 100mm front and rear suspension with a super-light and super-plush RockShox SID SE fork. Plus, a TwistLoc dual remote suspension lockout, SRAM Level Ultimate carbon brakes, and a carbon handlebar and seatpost.
<h4>The final word</h4>
So. Much. Carbon. This is hands down the fastest full suspension XC mountain bike we make, trimmed with the best parts out there. A full OCLV Mountain Carbon frame, top-of-the-line suspension, and carbon components come together in Top Fuel 9.9 SL to make the fastest bike on the line. The rest is up to you.
