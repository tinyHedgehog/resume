<h4>It's right for you if...</h4>
You believe mountain biking isn't about racing or showing off. It's about the experience of being out there in the rough, wonderful wild. For you, every ride is both a battle against nature and an appreciation of it. There's a whole lot of beauty in dirt, rocks, and roots. Trails don't need to be perfectly sculpted to be enjoyed.
<h4>The tech you get</h4>
An Alpha Platinum Aluminum frame with a Straight Shot down tube for extra stiffness in the rough and a Knock Block steerer stop to protect against spinning bars. A full SRAM GX Eagle 1x12 drivetrain with a huge gear range, a Fox Float rear shock with 130mm of travel and Trek's exclusive RE:aktiv damper, a 130mm RockShox Pike fork with a wide range of adjustment, aggressive 29x3.0? Bontrager XR4 Tubeless Ready mid-fat tires on beefy 40mm rims, and a Bontrager Dropper post.
<h4>The final word</h4>
This is a new breed of performance backcountry trail bike. If you love seeking out the untamed trails in the wild and discovering new lines while ripping bikepacking adventures, Full Stache 8 is your dream ride. It's like that one friend who's always egging you on to go a little farther, because there's bound to be something epic right over the next ridge or at the bottom of the next valley.
