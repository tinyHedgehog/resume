<h4>It's right for you if...</h4>
You want the fastest downhill bike we offer. You want the speed of 29? wheels and the stability of a full-on DH frame. You seek out the fastest lines, and the biggest jumps. You like to dial in your ride, and want the ability to fine-tune your suspension, fit, and handling on a bike that makes no compromises.
<h4>The tech you get</h4>
An OCLV Mountain Carbon frame, 190mm tunable front and rear FOX Factory air suspension, Bontrager Line DH wheels, and proven Shimano Saint drivetrain and brakes. This is a full-on DH race bike, and it's built so you can refine your setup for your fastest runs with Mino Link and an adjustable fixed-angle headset.
<h4>The final word</h4>
Best frame, best suspension, best parts, and fast-rolling 29? wheels. This is the only choice if you're a true DH devotee. Session 9.9 is simply the fastest bike on the mountain, even when that mountain is a stop on the World Cup circuit.
