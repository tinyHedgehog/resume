<h4>Bigger feet for when the snow is deep</h4>
The small white-furred, long-bearded men with enormous feet of Swiss folklore, a Barbegazi only emerge from their cave after the first snowfall. The aptly-named, ultra-fat, Tubeless Ready, Barbegazi TLR gives you the float and traction to take on any winter trail. 4.7 inches of aggressive tread floats over and bites into everything in its path.
