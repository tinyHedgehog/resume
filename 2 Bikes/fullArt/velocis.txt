<h4>Go the distance</h4>
When you're ready to add more miles, the Velocis Endurance Road Cycling Jersey can take you there. Expandable back pockets open up to hold more on longer days, or lay flat like traditional pockets for shorter excursions. Made from our best Profila fabrics, this jersey is enhanced by 37.5 technology, which uses body heat to evaporate moisture and keep you cool and dry.
