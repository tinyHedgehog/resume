<h4>It's right for you if...</h4>
You want the performance of carbon in a trail-shredding package. You love the quick handling of 27.5? wheels and the plush ride of a long travel bike, and want a durable parts group and a strong, light OCLV Mountain Carbon frame to handle whatever the trail can dish out.
<h4>The tech you get</h4>
A lightweight OCLV Mountain Carbon frame with an alloy rear triangle for added value. Plus, a RockShox 160mm Lyrik RC fork, 150mm rear travel with an ultra-responsive RE:aktiv shock, a 1x12 SRAM NX Eagle drivetrain, Bontrager Line Comp 30 wheels with a 54-tooth Rapid Drive hub for fast engagement, and a Bontrager Line dropper post.
<h4>The final word</h4>
A stiff carbon frame that's built for rugged riding and gnarly trails, with great suspension and a solid, dependable parts group. It shreds right out of the box, but it's also the perfect platform for upgrades down the line should you ever want to customize your trail ride.
