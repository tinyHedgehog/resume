<h4>It's right for you if...</h4>
You don't like fat biking-you love it. You make the biggest investment in your fat bike because you have the best time riding it, and you're willing to shell out for the lightest, fastest, fat bike we make because you know there's a return in fun, speed, and adventure.
<h4>The tech you get</h4>
A lightweight OCLV Mountain Carbon frame with Stranglehold dropouts, a Bontrager Haru rigid carbon fork, a SRAM GX Eagle 1x12 drivetrain with an extra-wide gear range, and Tubeless Ready carbon Bontrager Wampa wheels paired with 27.5x4.5? Bontrager Barbegazi TLR tires.
<h4>The final word</h4>
It's the lightest fat bike we make. A carbon frame, carbon wheels, carbon fork, and top-shelf SRAM drivetrain come together in Farley 9.8 to make a high-performance ride that won't be slowed by foul weather, deep snow, or gnarly terrain.
