Slash 9.9 is the fastest enduro mountain bike in the lineup, so it's no surprise it's the go-to ride for the pros of Trek Factory Racing Enduro. Carbon where it counts, FOX Factory fork, Trek's exclusive RE:aktiv with Thru Shaft shock, fast-rolling carbon 29er wheels, and a SRAM X01 Eagle drivetrain make this top-of-the-line ride the undisputed king of enduro.
