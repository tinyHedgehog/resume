Remedy 9.7 brings the ride quality of OCLV Mountain Carbon to our all-mountain family. A long travel 160mm RockShox Lyrik RC fork, 150mm rear suspension, Bontrager Line dropper post, and a 1x12 SRAM NX Eagle drivetrain make Remedy 9.7 a high-end carbon mountain bike that's built to get rowdy but doesn't come with the sticker shock of most carbon trail bikes.
