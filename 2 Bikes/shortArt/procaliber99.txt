When it comes to cross country hardtails, it doesn't get better than Procaliber 9.9 SL. The highest-end mountain bike in our Procaliber family is dressed to impress, with an SL OCLV Mountain Carbon layup that's a lot lighter than our non-SL frame, an advanced RockShox SID SE Carbon fork, Bontrager Kovee Pro 30 carbon wheels, and a SRAM XX1 Eagle drivetrain.
