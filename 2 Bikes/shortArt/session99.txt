Session 9.9 is the pinnacle of downhill mountain bike performance. It's built for one reason: going as fast as freakin' possible down hills. It pairs proven Shimano Saint parts with our premium OCLV Mountain Carbon frame and FOX Factory suspension with super-fast 29" wheels. This is the same DH bike the pros ride, and the bike of choice for World Champion Gee Atherton.
